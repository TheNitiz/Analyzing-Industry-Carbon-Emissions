# CO2 Emissions Data Analysis Using MySQL
## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing CO2 emissions data from various countries over the years using MySQL. The dataset includes key metrics such as total CO2 emissions (in thousand metric tons) and emissions per capita. The project explores SQL queries for data cleaning, filtering, and analysis, focusing on providing insights into the global emissions trends.

## Key Features
Data Cleaning: Removed unnecessary data points (like Emissions per capita rows) to focus on overall CO2 emissions.
Data Transformation: Applied SQL functions for data normalization and transformation, preparing it for effective analysis.
Data Analysis: Used various SQL queries to extract insights, such as finding the top CO2 emitting countries, identifying trends over decades, and calculating average emissions.
## SQL Queries & Operations
Delete Unnecessary Rows: Removed rows containing specific text in a column (using REGEXP for pattern matching).
Emissions Trend Analysis: Filtered the data by country and year to track the changes in emissions over time.
Aggregation: Performed aggregate queries to get the total and average emissions for different countries and years.
Data Filtering: Implemented filtering to identify countries with the highest emissions and trends over time.
## Insights & Analysis
Top Emitters: Identified countries with the highest emissions over the years.
Emissions Growth: Tracked CO2 emissions growth in countries and analyzed it across different decades.
Per Capita Emissions: Filtered out unnecessary Emissions per capita data to focus on total emissions.
Data Visualization: Future scope includes using tools like Power BI or Python to visualize emissions data trends.
## Technologies Used
MySQL: For querying, filtering, and analyzing the dataset.
SQL Queries: Applied various SQL operations such as DELETE, REGEXP, GROUP BY, and JOIN.
Data Cleaning: Handled raw data cleanup to make it suitable for analysis.
## How to Run
Clone the repository.
Import the dataset into MySQL.
Run the provided SQL scripts for data analysis and cleaning.
Modify queries to explore specific insights or trends based on the data.
## Future Scope
Integrate Power BI for interactive visualization of CO2 emissions trends.
Extend the project by analyzing different regions and comparing their emissions.
Introduce predictive analytics using machine learning algorithms.
## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how MySQL can be used for effective data cleaning, transformation, and analysis. By analyzing CO2 emissions data, businesses and researchers can gain valuable insights into global emissions trends, helping drive informed decisions for sustainability and climate action.
